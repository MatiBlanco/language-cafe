# Language Cafe - Villa la Angostura

## Description
This is the landing page for the upcoming (English) Language Cafe, taking place in Villa la Angostura, Argentina. A non-commercial endeavor meant to offer people a place where to practice their english speaking skills, free of charge.

The website is meant to display the day, time and place for the biweekly meetings, and a link to join the Whatsapp group.

## Dev info
This is a a simple HTML/CSS project, with distinct mobile and desktop layouts. Small UI bugs still need to be fixed, regarding font styling and proper spacing at different parts of the site.

## Acknowledgements
The design of the logo being used, belongs to "Georgia Tech Language Institute" (Atlanta, USA). We incorporated it into our project, since we don't have the necessary resources to invest in designing our own.

We are grateful for their help, and we're open to communicating with them in case they disagree with the actions we've taken.
